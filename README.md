# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to my Pathfinding Visualizer! In a recent pursuit, I had been exposed to the world of AI path-finding, search, and wall-building. After that exposure, I decided that I need to explore the topic further, and solidify my understanding by building an app. I will continuously add to the application with more algorithms. In the meantime, please take a look and have fun!
